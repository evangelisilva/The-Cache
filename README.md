# File Exchange Cache Service and Reliable Data Transport Protocols
This project involves implementing a cache service for file exchange and developing two reliable data transport protocols to facilitate secure and efficient data transfer.

The project is structured into two main components:
1. Cache Service for File Exchange: A caching mechanism that stores and serves files to improve efficiency during file exchanges.
2. Reliable Data Transport Protocols: Implementations of two protocols for reliable data transfer:
- TCP-based Protocol: Uses standard TCP for reliable data transfer.
- UDP with Stop-and-Wait (SNW) Protocol: Implements Stop-and-Wait reliability at the application layer while using UDP as the transport protocol.
